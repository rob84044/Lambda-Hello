/Hello, my name is Robert Pedersen.
Determined.
Helpful.
Friendly.

My favorite hobby as of right now is actually programming. I enjoy the statisfaction of seeing a piece of my code being turned into a completed and finished product. I started coding in early 2018, and I decided to start LambdaSchool in January of 2019. I got enrolled into lambdaschool in webpt5 on 02/25/2019. I expect to have a job around the 9 month mark as long as it allows me to continue my education via lambdaschool until official graduation.
